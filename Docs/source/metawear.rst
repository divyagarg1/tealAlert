MetaWear
========

The `MBLMetaWear <https://www.mbientlab.com/docs/metawear/ios/latest/Classes/MBLMetaWear.html>`_ class is your digital representation of a physical MetaWear board.  It contains all the logical methods you would expect for interacting with the device, such as connecting, disconnecting, reading and writing state.

Sensors and peripherals on the MetaWear are encapsulated within their own objects accessible via properties.  For example, all ``accelerometer`` functionality is contained in the `MBLAccelerometer <https://www.mbientlab.com/docs/metawear/ios/latest/Classes/MBLAccelerometer.html>`_ class and is accessed using the ``accelerometer`` property

You always get a `MBLMetaWear <https://www.mbientlab.com/docs/metawear/ios/latest/Classes/MBLMetaWear.html>`_ object through the `MBLMetaWearManager <https://www.mbientlab.com/docs/metawear/ios/latest/Classes/MBLMetaWearManager.html>`_ , afterwards, keep a reference to it as long as the app is running.  From here on assume that inside code blocks ``device`` is a `MBLMetaWear <https://www.mbientlab.com/docs/metawear/ios/latest/Classes/MBLMetaWear.html>`_ object reference

Connect/Disconnect
------------------

Before doing anything with the MetaWear board, your first step is to establish a connection:

The task returned from ``connectAsync`` will be completed after the connection is complete.  There is no timeout feature, so block might not be invoked for a long time if the device is out of range.  If error != nil (which certainly can happen, so handle it!) then the connection wasn't successful and you should try again.

The block passed to ``connectWithTimeoutAsync:`` will be called after the connection is complete, or timeout seconds have passed.  If a timeout occurs, the block will get an error of kMBLErrorDomain and kMBLErrorConnectionTimeout code.

::

    [[device connectAsync] success:^(MBLMetaWear * _Nonnull result) {
        NSLog(@"Connected");
        [[device disconnectAsync] success:^(MBLMetaWear * _Nonnull result) {
            NSLog(@"Disconnected");
        }];
    }];

    // connectAsync will try to connect indefinitely, but using
    // connectWithTimeoutAsync: is a simple way to limit the amount of
    // time spent searching for the device
    [[device connectWithTimeoutAsync:20] failure:^(NSError * _Nonnull error) {
        if ([error.domain isEqualToString:kMBLErrorDomain] &&
             error.code == kMBLErrorConnectionTimeout) {
            NSLog(@"Connection Timeout");
        }
    }];

Saving MetaWears
----------------

If you expect to re-connect to a specific MetaWear device, you can "remember" it for easy retrieval later on through the MetaWear Manager.

Once you are done with the device, then "forget" it to remove it from the list.

::

    [device rememberDevice];

::

    [device forgetDevice];

Firmware Updates
----------------

The firmware running on the MetaWear is periodically updated by MbientLab with additional features and bug-fixes.  To update, you first call a MetaWear API which puts the device in a special bootloader mode, then use the Nordic Semiconductor `IOS-DFU-Librarly <https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/IOS-DFU-Library>`_ to upload the new firmware.  We recommend looking at our `Sample App <https://github.com/mbientlab/Metawear-SampleiOSApp>`_ for an example on how to integrate.

This is one API you can call WITHOUT being connected, there are some cases where you can't connect because the firmware is too old, but you still need to be able to update it!

::

    [[[device prepareForFirmwareUpdateAsync] success:^(MBLFirmwareUpdateInfo * _Nonnull result) {
        DFUFirmware *selectedFirmware;
        if ([result.firmwareUrl.pathExtension caseInsensitiveCompare:@"zip"] == NSOrderedSame) {
            selectedFirmware = [[DFUFirmware alloc] initWithUrlToZipFile:result.firmwareUrl];
        } else {
            selectedFirmware = [[DFUFirmware alloc] initWithUrlToBinOrHexFile:result.firmwareUrl urlToDatFile:nil type:DFUFirmwareTypeApplication];
        }

        DFUServiceInitiator *initiator = [[DFUServiceInitiator alloc] initWithCentralManager:result.centralManager target:result.target];
        [initiator withFirmwareFile:selectedFirmware];
        initiator.forceDfu = YES; // We also have the DIS which confuses the DFU library
        initiator.logger = self; // - to get log info
        initiator.delegate = self; // - to be informed about current state and errors
        initiator.progressDelegate = self; // - to show progress bar
        initiator.peripheralSelector = self;

        [initiator start];
    }] failure:^(NSError * _Nonnull error) {
        NSLog(@"Something went wrong, we should try again in 60 seconds: %@", error);
        return;
    }];

Persistent Configuration
------------------------

``MBLRestorable`` object containing custom settings and events that are programmed to the MetaWear and preserved between disconnects and app termination.

Use ``setConfigurationAsync:`` to assign a new configuration object to this MetaWear.  This only needs to be called once, likely after you confirm the device from a scanning screen or such.  Upon calling it will erase all non-volatile memory the device (which requires disconnect), then perform reset, once its comes back online we will connect and invoke the runOnDeviceBoot method.   All calls in that method are persisted device side so after any future reset these settings will be applied automatically.

The properties of the configuration objected are automatically persisted to disk after interactions with the board.  If, however, you make changes to various module setting without acutally interacting, then it may be useful to call ``synchronizeAsync`` to force a save to disk.

::

    [[[device setConfigurationAsync:[[DeviceConfiguration alloc] init]] success:^(MBLMetaWear * _Nonnull result) {
        NSLog(@"Settings successfully applied");
    }] failure:^(NSError * _Nonnull error) {
        NSLog(@"Something went wrong, we should try again: %@", error);
    }];

Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI)
-----------------------------------------

RSSI is a measurement of the power present in a received radio signal. This can be used to approximate how close the MetaWear is to the Apple device, bigger numbers mean closer.

::

    [[device readRSSIAsync] success:^(NSNumber * _Nonnull result) {
        NSLog(@"RSSI: %@", result);
    }];

Battery Life
------------

You can query the percent charge remaining on the MetaWear anytime. You get back an integer between 0 and 100 indicating the percent remaining.

::

    [[device readBatteryLifeAsync] success:^(NSNumber * _Nonnull result) {
        NSLog(@"Battery Percent Remaining: %@", result);
    }];

Connection State
----------------

Get the state of the BLE connection.

::

    if (device.state == MBLConnectionStateConnected) {
        NSLog(@"Connected!");
    }

Programmed by Other Application
-------------------------------

Since we do not support using a single MetaWear device with multiple application, you should take care if a user accidently tries to do this.  Once connected, your application should check this BOOL and if it is YES, then you shouldn't change settings or perform any operations unless you supply the user with an alert saying, "This device is in use by another application, are you sure you want to reprogram it?  This will cause errors and data loss for the other application‚Äù.  If they agree then you need to call setConfigurationAsync: to take ownership of the device.

::

    if (device.programedByOtherApp) {
        NSLog(@"WARNING - device already programmed, are you sure you want to continue?  Call [device setConfigurationAsync:nil] if you wish to take ownership.");
    }

Identifier
----------

Apple generates a unique identifier for each BLE device.  Note, two different Apple devices will generate two different identifiers for the same MetaWear.

::

    NSLog(@"%@", device.identifier);

Device Name
-----------

By using the ``name`` property you can change the advertised ``name`` of the MetaWear.

::

    device.name = @"HAMMER";
