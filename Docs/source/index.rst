MetaWear iOS/macOS/tvOS API
===========================

Getting Started
---------------

If you haven't installed the SDK yet, please head over to the `QuickStart guide <https://github.com/mbientlab/MetaWear-SDK-iOS-macOS-tvOS>`_ on our Github page to get the SDK up and running in Xcode. You can also check out our `API Reference <http://mbientlab.com/docs/metawear/ios/latest/index.html>`_ for more detailed information about our SDK.

Overview
--------

The MetaWear platform is your one-stop shop for wearable sensor solutions. Our goal is to completely eliminate the need for product developers to build hardware or write firmware code.

You will, however, need fundamental knowledge of iOS, macOS, or tvOS programming especially either `Objective-C <https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ProgrammingWithObjectiveC/Introduction/Introduction.html>`_ and `Blocks <https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ProgrammingWithObjectiveC/WorkingwithBlocks/WorkingwithBlocks.html>`_ or `Swift <https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/index.html>`_ and `Closures <https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Closures.html>`_.

If you are not developing for the Apple ecosystem, we also offer an `Android API <http://mbientlab.com/androiddocs/latest/>`_ and `C++ API <https://mbientlab.com/cppdocs/latest/>`_.
