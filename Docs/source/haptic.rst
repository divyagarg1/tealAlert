Haptic
======

The MetaWear can be outfitted with either a haptic motor or a buzzer, encapsulated with the `MBLHapticBuzzer <http://mbientlab.com/docs/metawear/ios/latest/Classes/MBLHapticBuzzer.html>`_ object

Start Haptic
------------

The haptic motor has 2 parameters.  First, duty cycle [0, 255], which corresponds to strength of vibration.  Second, pulse width, or how long to buzz (units in ms).

::

    [device.hapticBuzzer startHapticWithDutyCycleAsync:255 pulseWidth:500 completion:nil];

Start Buzzer
------------

The buzzer has just a pulse width parameter, or how long to buzz (units in ms).

::

    [device.hapticBuzzer startBuzzerWithPulseWidthAsync:500 completion:nil];
